                  Once upon a time there was a baboon named Chang. He was a very clever
                  ape. He loved stealing food from humans. One day mzee Kokoo saw that
                  his potatoes and carrots were missing. He held a meeting with Simba
                  the lion king. All the smartest animals including Chang were called
                  to give advice and have a fair trial.  They sugested that they ask
                  every one of the animals if they did it. But Chang  himself sugested
                  that they have a trap set if the thief comes again. Chang had a plan
                  to eliminate the threat of anyone catching him stealing. He was one 
                  of the people to set the trap for and he was their leader because he
                  was the most agile and smartest of the team. He lied to the hyena 
                  that he was there to test the trap and whatever way it goes he gets
                  food. At midnight  the hyena went and got caught in the trap and wrestled
                  with Dodo the mans daughter. The hyena was exiled from the land and the
                  old man was at peace.  A week later the old man died and his paranoid
                  son inherited his land. While the man died the boy was in the room.
                  when he left to spread the news chang made a gash in the mans chest 
                  and poured blood on it. After Chang escaped he shouted that it was
                  the boy who killed him. The lion believed him and ordered an execution.
                  Meanwhile his inteligent sister was colecting the data that that the camera
                  she placed on Chang earlier. She showed the lion the proof  and chand was 
                  killed in place of the boy.The moral is use your inteligence wisely dont be
                  Evil with it
