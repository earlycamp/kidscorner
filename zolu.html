Once upon a time there lived a monkey named ZOLU.
Zolu loved eating bannanas and sometimes she would
even go to the extent of stealing them.
one day Zolu decided she wanted cooked bananas and
pork for lunch but she ran out of bannanas.
She went to her farm to look for some bannanas but none
had grown.She decided she would steal from some humans.
The humans however set a trap for her. They stole all her 
bannanas to set the perfect trap."This will teach Zolu not to
steal our food.  "  said one man. "Indeed brother."said his
sister. Mean while Zolu was swinging around looking for
bananas and then she saw a cargo truck that had
overturned.The people inside had fainted so she was
free to do whatever she wants. Hardly ad she touched a 
bannana than the door closed .She felt as if she was 
falling untill suddenly she felt an earth quake.
When the door opened she stumled into a cage.
The humans came beat her up and locked the cage.
"What will we do with her?" asked the man.
"Simple, we give her a death penalty"answered 
his sister. When Zolu heard her she wanted to escape.
She asked for food and when the man came she snatched the key.
She unlocked the cage and dashed to the next country.
From then on she decided never to steal again. </p></div></div>
